# MGH8060
SC/MP INS8060-based microcomputer running National Industrial Basic Language (NIBL)

This project is very similar to my other IN8060-based project [->"MGH8060"<-](https://github.com/Kris-Sekula/MGH8060) but uses a programmable logic device (GAL22V10) instead of discrete logic for address decoding.

Here is an overview of the device:

### Schematic
[Schematic - Version 1.2](Hardware/mgh8060gal_v1.4.pdf)

### Credits

* Early versions of my design were reviewed by Phil(aka [Retro Phil](https://www.mccrash-racing.co.uk/philg/picl/picl.htm)) who offered a lot of helpful suggestions, he also contributed all the firmware for MGH8060 and MGH8060GAL

## Release Notes

I used Winbond W27C512 (EEPROM pin compatible with standard EPROMs)

Please consider getting the PCB from my sponsor PCBWay
